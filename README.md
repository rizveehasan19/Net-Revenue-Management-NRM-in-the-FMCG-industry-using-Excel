Net revenue management (NRM) is a strategic approach designed to maximise the profitability of a brand. There are 5 pillars or initiatives that have been collectively driving businesses to an esmitated extent of 66% across industries. 
I have implemented this in this case study in the FMCG domain. Lets dive into these initiatives one by one to understand the process:

ðŸš€Brand Portfolio Pricing:
This initiaative determines or validates the price of a product based on the value it offers, customers' willingness to pay, pricing strategy of the competitors, regions where the business is operating & the channels through which it is being distributed.

ðŸš€Mix Management:
One brands might have more contribution to the net sales & another might drive more in terms of profitability. Mix Management shares this insight on when to push which product. 
In this project, I have created a profitability matrix to map this distribution in terms of profitability & net sales contribution
